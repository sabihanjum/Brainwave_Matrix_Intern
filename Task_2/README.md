# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using ML (Random Forest)

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The focus is on preprocessing transaction data, handling imbalanced datasets, and training models to evaluate their performance. The model used in this project is the **Random Forest** classifier, with attention to anomaly detection, data balancing, and model evaluation.

## Requirements

Install the following libraries before starting:

- **Pandas**: For importing and managing datasets.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Importing Libraries and Datasets
First, we import the required libraries and load the dataset using Pandas.

### 2. Data Understanding
In this step, we analyze the structure of the dataset by checking its shape, column details, and identifying any missing values.

### 3. Exploring and Analyzing the Data
We will explore the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions and visualize key features. This includes plotting a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and the target variable.

### 4. Handling Imbalanced Data
Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset (0.17% fraudulent transactions), we will initially train the model without any balancing techniques and evaluate its performance. If the accuracy is inadequate, we can explore various techniques for handling the imbalance, such as resampling methods.

### 5. Model Training, Evaluation, and Prediction

#### Building the Random Forest Model:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the Random Forest model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the confusion matrix to assess performance.

## Conclusion
The **Random Forest** model was trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Initial evaluation results showed:
- Accuracy: **(Random Forest Accuracy)**
- Precision: **(Precision Score)**
- Recall: **(Recall Score)**
- F1 Score: **(F1 Score)**

## Results
Include visualizations of model performance, such as confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Future Work
Future improvements may involve:
- Exploring other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, SVM).
- Implementing data balancing techniques such as SMOTE.
- Incorporating additional feature engineering to improve model performance.
