# Fake News Detection Using ML (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying news as **fake** or **real** using machine learning techniques. We preprocess the news data, convert text into numerical vectors, and train models to evaluate their performance. The models used include **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**, with a focus on text data preprocessing, vectorization, and model evaluation.

## Requirements

Install the following libraries before starting:

- **Pandas**: For importing and managing datasets.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training, vectorization, and evaluation.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing (text cleaning, stopword removal).

---

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Importing Libraries and Datasets
First, we import the required libraries and dataset using Pandas.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
To analyze the structure of the dataset and find missing values or errors, the shape and column details are retrieved:

### 3. Preprocessing and Analysis of News Column
The text data in the **News** column needs to be cleaned by removing:
- **Stopwords**: Common words like 'the', 'is', 'in', which do not add meaning.
- **Punctuation**: Characters like '.', ',', which are unnecessary for machine learning models.

For this, the **NLTK** library is used:

### 4. Converting Text into Vectors
The next step involves converting text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF** vectorization. Before that, split the dataset into training and testing sets:

### 5. Model Training, Evaluation, and Prediction

#### Logistic Regression:


#### Decision Tree Classifier:

## Conclusion
The **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** models performed well in classifying news as fake or real. Here are the accuracy results:
- Logistic Regression: **(Logistic Regression Accuracy)**
- Decision Tree Classifier: **(Decision Tree Accuracy)**

---

## Results
- Both models show significant accuracy, with Logistic Regression typically outperforming Decision Trees on this type of problem due to its robustness with text data.
- Proper text cleaning and vectorization using **TF-IDF** significantly improve model performance.

---

## Future Work
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** can further improve the performance of these models.
- Additional models like **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machines**, and **XGBoost** can be explored.
- Perform a more detailed analysis of the feature importance for each model.
